# A51-vm
Personal virtual machine, for learning purposes  
A51 -> Area 51  
A51 is currently a register based vm. It is not very complex and currently has only 5 instructions.  
ADD  
MOVE  
MUL  
LOAD  
HALT  

The whole implementation is in the file A51vm.lua, because I still do not know how to import other lua files into my own lua file.
